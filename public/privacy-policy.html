  <h1>µTox Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This is the µTox privacy policy. Its purpose is to explain how the µTox app uses the data that is passed to it when you are using the app.</p>
  <p>µTox protects and respects your privacy. This means no data will shared with a third party in any way.</p>

  <h2>Chat Messages, Video and Audio Data</h2>

  <p>If you send messages to friends in single chats as well as group chats, these messages are only visible to the members of the chat.</p>
  <p>The same is true for video and audio data.</p>
  <p>Direct-connections are established between you and your contacts. All messages sent over the network are encrypted.</p>
  <p>This means that there is nobody in-between who could read the messages.</p>

  <h2>The Tox Network</h2>

  <p>For establishing a connection with your friends, the app will connect with several computers or phones on the internet that have µTox installed. Together they form the Tox Network. This network allows µTox to find your friends and connect to them when they are online. </p>
  <p>All messages on the Tox Network are encrypted, so only those can read the data that are allowed to.</p>
  <p>No other data except for finding friends and sending friend requests is sent over the Tox Network.</p>
  <p>Chat Messages and Audio or Video data are sent encrypted directly between you and your friends.</p>

  <h2>Camera and Microphone</h2>

  <p>µTox needs permission to use your Camera and Microphone to be able to provide Audio and Video calls.</p>
  <p>The microphone will only be turned on if you start an audio call. The same is true for the camera, it will only be enabled if you start a video call or make a photo you want to share with a friend.</p>
